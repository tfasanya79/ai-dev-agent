✅ Phase 1: Core Setup
✔️ Created project structure with agents/, generators/, etc.

✔️ CLI working with two modes: coordinator & spec.

✅ Phase 2: Agent Orchestration
✔️ CoordinatorAgent prompts user, gets input.

✔️ Project is initialized locally with a virtualenv & Git.

✔️ GitHub push working with token.

✅ Phase 3: Code Generation MVP (You're Here)
✔️ Frontend and backend generators exist.

✔️ Generated code is written to disk.

✔️ Project scaffolds are valid.

⚠️ Still basic logic, no real code parsing or advanced modeling yet.
